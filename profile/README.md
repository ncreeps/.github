# Welcome to nCreeps 👾

Welcome, brave soul, to the haunted repository of nCreeps. If you're reading this, it's too late—you've already fallen into the abyss of code and chaos. 

## About Us 🕵️‍♂️

We are the nCreeps, a merry band of cybersecurity maniacs and digital daredevils. Our mission? To find bugs, break systems, and occasionally make the internet a safer place—when we're not too busy trolling each other. 

## Our Manifesto 📜

1. **Break Everything**: If it ain't broke, it soon will be.
2. **Fix Nothing**: Just kidding... maybe.
3. **Profit**: Because we need to pay for our caffeine addiction somehow.

## Achievements 🏆

- **Survived 2023**: No small feat, considering our caffeine intake.
- **Bug Bounty Masters**: From Tesla to NASA, we've made friends in high places (and enemies too).
- **ShunyaCTF Organizers**: Because running a CTF is easier than facing real life.

## Projects 🚀
